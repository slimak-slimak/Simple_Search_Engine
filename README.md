# About
Simple project  done on Hyperskill platform as a part of JetBrains Academy course. 
It tought me how search engines work. It helped me understand search algorithms.

Program implementation consist of 6 stages. Each stage added some new funcionality and thus complexity.

**Learning outcomes according to Hyperskill**
Gain confidence in working with files and console, and learn how to optimize the search process.

# Used Java Tools
- Scanner 
- Arrays
- Loops
- Casting types + boxing & unboxing
- Linear search
- OOP
- Basic Exception handling
- Inheritance
- Files
- Pseudocode basics
- Polimorphism
- Interfaces
- Template method
- Generics
- Collections (List, Set, Map)


# How to use the program
The program  process the command line argument --data, after which the name of the file with the data goes. For example,** --data text.txt.**

In this case we have a list of people, but the program can be easly adapted for other search purposes.

The program prints simple menu:

`=== Menu ===`

`1. Find a person`

`2. Print all people`

`0. Exit`

To use the program type 1, 2 or 3 then follow the instructions printed. The program will come back to menu after each operation. To terminate the program, please type 0.

Note that the Inverted Index is not intended to search for parts of a word, it is only used to search for full words.

Remember that you must **create -- data file !**

# Plans for future improvement
- implementation of stage 6 (Design Pattern)
- Unit Tests
- code refactoring
- documentation
